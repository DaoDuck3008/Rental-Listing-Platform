# 🛡️ Rental Listing Platform - Backend API Gateway

[English](#) | [🇻🇳 Bản Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)](./README.vi.md)

---

> **Description:** The core API gateway for the rental platform, built with Service-oriented architecture, robust security, and high performance.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This backend project is designed to handle real-world challenges such as **Performance Optimization (Redis)**, **Real-time Communication (Socket.io)**, and **Multi-layer Security (JWT/RBAC)**. 

It serves as the centralized engine of the Rental Listing Platform, providing data services to the [Frontend Application](https://github.com/DaoDuck3008/FE-Rental-Listing-Platform), ensuring data integrity, secure authentication, and efficient state synchronization.


---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Runtime:** Node.js (ES Modules)
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with **Sequelize ORM**
- **Caching:** **Redis** (Used for high-traffic view counting & rate limiting)
- **Security:** Helmet, CORS, Argon2/Bcrypt, express-rate-limit.
- **Validation:** **Zod** (End-to-end data integrity).
- **Other:** Socket.io (Real-time), Cloudinary (Images), Nodemailer (Emails), Node-cron (Jobs).

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Advanced Authentication & RBAC
- **JWT Flow:** Full implementation of Login/Logout with **Access Tokens** and **Refresh Tokens**.
- **Social Login:** Integrated Google OAuth 2.0.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Secure routes for `Admin`, `Host`, and `User`.

### 2. High Performance View Counting
- **Redis Cache:** Listing views are stored in Redis first to reduce primary database write load.
- **Cron Jobs:** Background processes synchronize view counts from Redis to PostgreSQL periodically.

### 3. Comprehensive Listing Management
- **Search & Filtering:** Complex Postgres queries for location, price ranges, and property types.
- **Image Processing:** Automated uploads and optimizations via Cloudinary.

### 4. Real-time Notifications
- **Socket.io Integration:** Toast notifications for users when listings are updated or chats are received.
